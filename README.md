## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Khushal Sethiya** – a Computer Science student at Trent University, specializing in **Data Analytics** with a minor in **Business Administration**.

🚀 I’m currently learning and building projects in full-stack development, machine learning, and financial modeling.  
📊 Passionate about solving real-world problems through data, code, and creative strategy.  
🧠 I serve as the **Vice President of Outreach for HackTrent 2025**, leading sponsorship efforts and helping organize Trent’s largest hackathon.  
🏛️ I’m also the **VP of Case Competitions & Conferences** at **TBSA**, where I coordinate academic events that bridge the gap between business theory and industry practice.  
🤝 I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams and taking on leadership roles that push me to grow.  
🍜 Outside of tech, I love cooking, playing sports, and learning about new investment trends.
